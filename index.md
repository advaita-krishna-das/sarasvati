Sarasvati is a personal knowledge database. It starts with a single Thought and grows more powerful as you use it. Think of it as a living mind map with unlimited space for everything you want, are learning or need to remember. Each idea can grow and evolve with all related Thoughts instead of being separated in folders or lists. Use Sarasvati to manage specific projects or as an "everything in your life manager" to get the big picture on your ideas and find the right information in seconds.

## Integrate all your information in one place.
Your Brain can store an unlimited amount of all kinds of information. Write notes for all your ideas. Save files, web pages, images and even emails into TheBrain for instant access. Adding things is as simple as drag and drop.

## Find anything instantly
Activate any idea or file in seconds. Sarasvati not only brings up the right idea but lets you see how it relates to everything else... so you are prepared for anything. This means you can shift contexts quickly and get an immediate visual briefing by viewing connected topics.
