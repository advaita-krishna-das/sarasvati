Sarasvati is a personal knowledge database. It starts with a single Thought and grows more powerful as you use it. Think of it as a living mind map with unlimited space for everything you want, are learning or need to remember. Each idea can grow and evolve with all related Thoughts instead of being separated in folders or lists. Use Sarasvati to manage specific projects or as an “everything in your life manager” to get the big picture on your ideas and find the right information in seconds.
